# Orders API HTTP 500 Error - Production Fix

## Issue

The orders page in sabri-admin was showing HTTP 500 errors in production.

## Root Cause

The API routes were attempting to populate the `user` reference with fields `name` and `email`, but the User model schema uses `firstName` and `lastName` instead of a single `name` field. This mismatch caused the populate operation to fail in production.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed User Population Fields

**Files Modified:**

- `app/api/admin/orders/route.js`
- `app/api/admin/orders/[id]/route.js`

**Changes:**

- Changed `.populate("user", "name email")` to `.populate("user", "firstName lastName email")`
- Added `.lean()` to queries for better performance and to return plain JavaScript objects

### 2. Added User Model Import

Both API route files now explicitly import the User model to ensure it's registered with Mongoose before population:

```javascript
import User from "@/lib/models/User";
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Added comprehensive error logging and conditional error message exposure:

- Added `error.stack` logging for better debugging
- Conditional error message exposure (only in development mode)
- Better error context for production debugging

## Code Changes

### Before:

```javascript
Order.find(filter).populate("user", "name email").sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

### After:

```javascript
Order.find(filter)
  .populate("user", "firstName lastName email")
  .sort({ createdAt: -1 })
  .lean();
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test in Development:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Navigate to `/dashboard/orders` and verify orders load correctly

2. **Test API Endpoints:**

   - GET `/api/admin/orders` - List orders
   - GET `/api/admin/orders?status=pending` - Filter by status
   - GET `/api/admin/orders?search=test` - Search orders
   - PUT `/api/admin/orders/[id]` - Update order status
   - DELETE `/api/admin/orders/[id]` - Delete order

3. **Deploy to Production:**
   After testing locally, deploy to production and monitor:
   - Server logs for any remaining errors
   - Orders page loads without 500 errors
   - Order statistics display correctly
   - Populate operations work correctly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Schema Consistency:** Ensure populate field names match the actual schema
2. **Model Imports:** Always import referenced models to ensure they're registered
3. **Use .lean():** For read-only operations to improve performance
4. **Error Logging:** Maintain comprehensive error logging with stack traces
5. **Type Safety:** Consider using TypeScript for schema validation

## Additional Notes

- The `.lean()` method returns plain JavaScript objects instead of Mongoose documents, which is more efficient for read operations
- The User model is properly imported in both route files to ensure Mongoose model registration
- Error messages are only exposed in development to avoid leaking sensitive information in production
