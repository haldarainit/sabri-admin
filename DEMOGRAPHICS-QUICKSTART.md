# 🗺️ Demographics Map - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

Your demographics map is now embedded directly in the Dashboard Overview.

## 🚀 Access the Page

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Log in to Sabri Admin
3. Go to Dashboard → Overview (the map section is titled "Customer Demographics")

Note: The old standalone route `/dashboard/demographics` now redirects to `/dashboard` to avoid duplication.

## 📍 What You'll See

### Statistics Cards (Top Row)

- **Total Orders**: All orders in your system
- **Unique Cities**: Number of different cities customers are from
- **States Covered**: Number of states with orders
- **Top City Orders**: Highest order count from a single city

### Interactive Map (Overview section)

- **Markers**: Show customer locations
- **Colors**: Indicate order volume
  - 🔴 Red = 50+ orders
  - 🟠 Orange = 20-49 orders
  - 🟡 Yellow = 10-19 orders
  - 🟢 Green = <10 orders
- **Click markers** to see details (city, state, order count, zip codes)
- **Zoom/Pan** using mouse or map controls

The embedded overview map is intentionally compact and focuses on a quick visual of order clusters. Advanced filters are available in the (now deprecated) standalone version and can be reintroduced later if needed.

### Top Cities

Shown within the map popup/context (detailed list available via API response if needed).

### State Distribution

The embedded version focuses on the map. A state-wise table can be added back if required.

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### 1. Find Your Best Markets

- Look at the "Top Cities List"
- Check red/orange markers on the map
- Review state distribution table

### 2. Plan Regional Marketing

- Use state filter to see specific regions
- Identify underserved areas (fewer markers)
- Target cities with potential

### 3. Optimize Shipping

- See which states have most orders
- Identify clustering patterns
- Plan warehouse locations

### 4. Customer Distribution Analysis

- Switch map views for better context
- Click markers for detailed info
- Export insights for reports

## 🔍 Tips & Tricks

1. **Zoom In**: Use mouse wheel to zoom into specific regions
2. **Filter Smart**: Start with state filter, then narrow to city
3. **Map Views**:
   - Street view for urban context
   - Satellite for geographic features
   - Terrain for elevation/topography
4. **Click Everything**: Markers, filters, and stats are all interactive

## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Data Source

All data comes from **order shipping addresses** in your MongoDB database.

### Refresh Rate

- Data loads when you open the page
- Refresh the page to see latest orders
- Statistics update automatically

### City Coordinates

- 100+ major Indian cities pre-mapped
- Cities without coordinates won't show on map (but still in stats)
- To add more cities: see `DEMOGRAPHICS-FEATURE.md`

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Map Not Loading?

- Check browser console (F12)
- Verify you have orders in database
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### No Markers?

- Check if orders have city/state in shipping address
- Verify cities are in the coordinate mapping
- Some cities may not have coordinates yet

### Slow Performance?

- Normal for 1000+ orders
- Consider date range filtering (future enhancement)
- Close other browser tabs

## 📁 Files Reference

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

Want to customize? Here are some quick wins:

### Change Colors

Edit `page.js`, find `getColor()` function:

```javascript
const getColor = (count) => {
  if (count >= 50) return "#your-color"; // Change this
  // ... more colors
};
```

### Add New Map Style

Edit `getTileLayerUrl()`:

```javascript
case "custom":
  return "https://your-tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png";
```

### Adjust Thresholds

Change order count thresholds in `getColor()` function.
